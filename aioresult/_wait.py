    The results are waited for in parallel, so they are sent to the channel in the order they
    complete rather than the order they are in the ``results`` iterable. As usual when waiting for
    async tasks, the ordering is not guaranteed for tasks that finish at very similar times.

    This function does not return until all tasks in ``results`` have completed, so it would
    normally be used by being passed to :meth:`trio.Nursery.start_soon()`, rather than being
    directly awaited in the caller.

    :param results: The :class:`ResultBase` objects to send to the channel.
    :param channel: The send end of the channel to send to.
    :param close_on_complete: If ``True`` (the default), the channel will be closed when the
        function completes. This means that iterating over the receive end of the channel with
        ``async for`` will complete once all results have been returned.

    .. warning::
        If ``close_on_complete`` is True and this routine is cancelled then the channel is still
        closed. (The close is done in a ``finally:`` block.) This means that, in this situation,
        an ``async for`` loop over the receive end will complete without all results being returned.
        This is done to avoid a recipient waiting forever.

        In practice, it will very often be the case that the same nursery is used for both this
        routine and the routine that iterates over the results. In that case, the ``async for``
        would be interrupted anyway.
