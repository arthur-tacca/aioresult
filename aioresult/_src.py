                * The exception is recorded in  ``start_result`` (because exceptions before startup is
                  complete are recorded in the context of the startup nursery).
                * The potentially surprising part is that the same exception is also recorded in
                  ``done_result`` (because ``done_result.run()`` directly wraps the call to the
                  routine).

            Another fiddly case is if the routine returns before it calls ``task_status.started()``:

                * This is considered an error so a ``RuntimeError`` exception is raised (see
                  :meth:`trio.Nursery.start()`), and again this is propagated out in only
                  ``start_nursery``, rather than ``run_nursery``.
                * This ``RuntimeError`` exception is recorded ``start_result``.
                * However, ``done_result`` records whatever result was returned by the routine, and
                  ``done_result.exception()`` is ``None`` (again, this is because ``done_result.run()``
                  directly wraps the call to the routine).

            Once the routine completes startup (i.e., after it has called ``task_status.started()``),
            the semantics are simple: any return value or exception is associated with ``done_result``,
            and the routine is now running in the context of ``run_nursery`` so any exception is
            propagated out into the ``run_nursery``.

            A consequence of all the above cases is that ``start_result.is_done()`` and
            ``done_result.is_done()`` **are eventually both true regardless of when and how the routine
